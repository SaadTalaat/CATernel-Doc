Loading process 
================
Currently we're only support ELF formats , elf_load_to_proc reads the binary from disk 
and populates the proc structure with the process information and sets the entry point.

typedef struct proc {
	gpr_regs_t 	gpr_regs;
	seg_regs_t 	seg_regs;
	reg_t		eip;
	uint32_t		cs;
	reg_t		eflags;
	reg_t		esp;
	uint32_t		ss;
	uint32_t	proc_id;
	uint32_t	proc_status;
	
	pde_t		*page_directory;
	uint32_t	cr3;
	uint32_t	preempted;
	uint32_t	dequeqed;
//	char 		proc_name[MAX_PROC_NAME];
	LIST_ENTRY(proc)	link;
	LIFO_ENTRY(proc)	q_link;
} proc_t;

The function will remind you of kenel fetching, based on the binary offset it will seek it and read the disk's block into an elfhdr 
structure , which will then iterate through the headers to copy the entire file into memory , update the page table and the CR3 register
as an initialization to the user environment.
